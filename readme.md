It is an application to know about yourself from other without seeing their information. In other word you can say anything about others but they can not see your information.


## usage:
You don't have to create an account to give your feedback to others. But if you are interested to know how people think about you then you have to create an account. Then you will get an unique url that you can share. Through this url anyone can give their opinion on you.

If you are really interested on what people think about you then give it a try. Hope you will find it useful.


## What is next?
After you know how you are to other people, you can then improve yourself accordingly to be a better human being.
