It is an application to know about yourself from other without seeing their information. In other word you can say anything about others but they can not see your information. <br>
To see the live application, visit: [truthwhisper.free.nf](http://truthwhisper.free.nf)




## Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
To setup this app in your local machine, first you need to install php locally. If it is already installed then you are good to go. And also install composer for package management.

### Installation
_Beside php you don't need anything to setup the app. Here are the steps to follow._
1. Clone the repo
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/mahadirazib/truthwhisper.git
  ```
2. Change the directory to public and start the server.
  ```sh
  cd public
  php -S localhost:8000
  ```



## usage:
You don't have to create an account to give your feedback to others. But if you are interested to know how people think about you then you have to create an account. Then you will get an unique url that you can share. Through this url anyone can give their opinion on you.

If you are really interested on what people think about you then give it a try. Hope you will find it useful.



## What is next?
After you know how you are to other people, you can then improve yourself accordingly to be a better human being.
